            This Cookie Policy explains how TechEvents ("we", "us", or "our") uses cookies and similar technologies on
            our website and applications (collectively, the "Service"). This Cookie Policy should be read alongside our
            Privacy Policy, which explains how we use personal information.
          </p>
          <p>
            By using our Service, you consent to the use of cookies and similar technologies in accordance with this
            Cookie Policy.
          </p>

          <h2>2. What Are Cookies?</h2>
          <p>
            Cookies are small text files that are placed on your device when you visit a website. They are widely used
            to make websites work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the owners of the site. Cookies
            allow websites to remember your preferences, device, and browsing activities.
          </p>

          <h2>3. Types of Cookies We Use</h2>
          <p>We use the following types of cookies on our Service:</p>

          <h3>3.1 Essential Cookies</h3>
          <p>
            These cookies are necessary for the Service to function properly. They enable core functionality such as
            security, network management, and account access. You may disable these by changing your browser settings,
            but this may affect how the Service functions.
          </p>

          <h3>3.2 Performance and Analytics Cookies</h3>
          <p>
            These cookies help us understand how visitors interact with our Service by collecting and reporting
            information anonymously. They help us improve our Service by measuring and analyzing user behavior.
          </p>

          <h3>3.3 Functionality Cookies</h3>
          <p>
            These cookies enable enhanced functionality and personalization. They may be set by us or by third-party
            providers whose services we have added to our pages. If you do not allow these cookies, some or all of these
            services may not function properly.
          </p>

          <h3>3.4 Targeting and Advertising Cookies</h3>
          <p>
            These cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you. They perform functions like
            preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed, and in some
            cases selecting advertisements that are based on your interests.
          </p>

          <h3>3.5 Social Media Cookies</h3>
          <p>
            These cookies are set by social media services that we have added to the site to enable you to share our
            content with your friends and networks. They are capable of tracking your browser across other sites and
            building a profile of your interests, which may impact the content and messages you see on other websites
            you visit.
          </p>

          <h2>4. Third-Party Cookies</h2>
          <p>
            In addition to our own cookies, we may also use various third-party cookies to report usage statistics of

          <h2>6. Other Tracking Technologies</h2>
          <p>
            In addition to cookies, we may use other similar technologies on our Service, such as web beacons (also
            known as clear GIFs or pixel tags) and local storage. These technologies work in a similar way to cookies
            and allow us to track user behavior, remember preferences, and gather usage information.
          </p>

          <h2>7. Do Not Track Signals</h2>
          <p>
            Some browsers have a "Do Not Track" feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your
            online activities tracked. At this time, our Service does not respond to Do Not Track signals.
          </p>
